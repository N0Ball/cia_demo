                                Dr. Cissi Lin’s research has been deeply motivated by the complex system that is characterized by the solar-terrestrial coupling processes. She has worked on model development and applications with the Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) for several years. GITM is a new generation of global circulation model to study atmosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling mechanisms. She also worked on spaceborne projects, such as Solar Dynamics Observatory, RAIDS on the International Space Station, and PolarNOx sounding rocket. Over 54 weeks in 2019-2020, she was deployed to Antarctica with a task of finding the connections between forcing from above/below and the atmosphere at 80-200 km by observing with a Fe Boltzmann lidar and a Na Doppler lidar. She is a frequent reviewer of scientific proposals, books, and journals, including Geophysical Research Letters, Journal of Geophysical Research, Space Weather, Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, Advance in Space Research, and Journal of Space Weather and Space Climate.
